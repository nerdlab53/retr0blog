## roadmap for learning ML in 2024

for learning ML in this day and age, I personally believe that one doesn't need to have to pay for any courses.. and so when one of my close friends asked me about a roadmap I began to wonder about what I should
recommend him, and so this post is actually a result of that, i began tracking back my footsteps and this came out as a result..

having said this, let me justify the below recommendations one by one in the order I have put them..



1. ML Stanford : [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rNH7qL6-efu_q2_bPuy0adh)

   ![ml](./assets/ml-roadmap-2024-assets/ml-course.png)
-  this is one of the best courses ever open sourced by Stanford Uni the CS229 is the best classroom (non-MOOC) I have seen and I myself have studied from the same, it is a pretty good course
   as it builds from the bottom using stats and prob. can definitely recommend this one given you have high school prob + stats knowledge. 




2. PyTorch : [pytorch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8IpyNZ21vUQw-TYaf2xF6SbUrqRKbGxh)

   ![pytorch](./assets/ml-roadmap-2024-assets/pytorch-dan-bourke.png)
-  this compilation of twitch streams from Daniel Bourke is a very good resource for learning one of the most used DL/ML frameworks in the world both in research and as well as industry, also the way of teaching that Daniel has is just simply amazing and that is why this one is worth it.




3. scikit-learn : [scikit-learn](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS1QulWo1RIa7ha9SewcZlsTQVwL7n7oq)

   ![scikit-learn](./assets/ml-roadmap-2024-assets/scikit-learn.png)
-  another good playlist to get familiarized with scikit-learn for ML as it is one of the easiest, basic and actually most important frameworks which I still use to this day even when     working with deep learning projects as it's got some pretty good standard functions for eg the split function.




4. Deep Learning : [practical-deep-learning](https://course.fast.ai/)

   ![practical-deep-learning](./assets/ml-roadmap-2024-assets/practical-dl.png)
-  i will not try to defend this one, this is just an essential in my opinion u will have to go through this masterpiece atleast once



5. NLP w/ DL : [NLP-Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMFqRtEuo6SGjY4XbRIVRd4)

   ![NLP](./assets/ml-roadmap-2024-assets/NLP-dl.png)
-  another Stanford Uni course (i'm a fanboy sorry) for NLP it's just a fantastic one so far as I am just about done with this one, pretty great to understand from the ground up and 
  it's another one which builds from the ground up to the advanced
   



6. CS231n Image Processing : [cs231n](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk)

   ![cs231n](./assets/ml-roadmap-2024-assets/cs-231n.png)
-  karpathy made this course



7. Implement older papers : [d2l](https://d2l.ai/)

   ![d2l](./assets/ml-roadmap-2024-assets/d2l.png)
-  as someone doing deep learning I believe u should get acquainted with the research that has been going on for the past decade or so (atleast) in deep learning, and there is no better way to do that other than implement older papers and then go ahead from there.. this is also an essential 



Also, so that you don't spend a lot of time on one single thing, here is a little suggestion from my side : 
ML + scikit-learn (3 weeks) -> PyTorch + Deep Learning (1 month) -> NLP w/DL / + CS231n (4-5 months with paper implementations)

that's all for this one see ya!
